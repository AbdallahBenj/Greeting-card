# Greeting Card - Certification Project

## Overview
This project is part of the certification requirements. In this workshop, I designed a **Greeting Card Web Page** using HTML and CSS. The goal is to creatively apply **CSS pseudo-classes** to build an interactive and visually engaging card.

## Project Details
- **Project Type**: Interactive Web UI Component
- **Purpose**: Practice using CSS pseudo-classes like `:hover`, `:focus`, `:nth-child`, and more in a practical, creative context.
- **Skills Learned**: CSS pseudo-classes, text styling, hover effects, animations, responsive design

## Features
- 💌 **Greeting Card Layout**: A beautifully structured card with a heading, message, and decorative elements.
- 🌟 **Hover Effects**: Used `:hover` to reveal parts of the message or trigger visual changes.
- 🔠 **Focus and Active Styling**: Styled input or buttons using `:focus` and `:active` for better UX.
- 🧩 **Dynamic Elements**: Styled specific elements using `:nth-child`, `:first-child`, `:last-child`, etc.
- 📱 **Responsive Design**: Card layout adjusts beautifully on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- 🖼️ **Creative Design**: Decorative shapes, gradients, or transitions added for a festive touch.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Page structure, text content, and semantic layout
- **CSS**: Pseudo-classes, transitions, positioning, and responsive techniques
